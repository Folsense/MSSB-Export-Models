MSSB Character Model Extractor v 1.0

This program will extract all character models from Mario Superstar Baseball

Please extract your ZZZZ.dat and put it in this folder.
Make sure you have python installed, you can double click RunMe.bat
Alternatively, you can run `python main.py`

Select a number from the given list to extract that character, or press enter to extract all characters.

Let me (Roeming#8394 on discord) know if anything fails


Notes:

Bat and ball models are grouped into the hand models, but due to quantization, don't appear right yet.

No animations are currently extracted, that is in the works.

Normals may be strange, so you might want to recalculate those in blender.
