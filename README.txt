MSSB Character Model Extractor v 1.0

This program will extract all character models from Mario Superstar Baseball

Please extract your ZZZZ.dat and put it in this folder.
Make sure you have python installed, then run runMe.py

```
python runMe.py
```

Select a number from the given list to extract that character, or press enter to extract all characters.

Let me (Roeming#8394 on discord) know if anything fails


Notes:

No hands or bats are currently extracted, that is in the works. This is because the game loads the hands separately so you can be righty or lefty.

No animations are currently extracted, that is in the works.

Normals may be strange, so you might want to recalculate those.
